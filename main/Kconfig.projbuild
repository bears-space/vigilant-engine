            Basic Authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent (e.g. a web browser)
            to provide a user name and password when making a request. It is the simplest
            technique for enforcing access controls to web resources. because it doesn't
            require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, it uses standard
            fields in the HTTP header.
            Note that, Basic Authentication is not encrypted channel and also easy to retrieve
            credentials as they are sent in plain text format.
